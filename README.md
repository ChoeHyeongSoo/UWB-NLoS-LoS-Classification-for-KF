# UWB-NLoS-LoS-Classification-for-KF
Research of NLoS probability calculation model based on UWB CIR using deep learning

[Abstract]  
-Classify the environment(LoS/NLoS) by analyzing CIR  
-The NLoS probability will be used as a parameter to update the process noise covariance in the KF

[Additional]  
-Try CNN+LSTM to improve accuracy

> Set all environment as follows:
1. [Reference Journal #1: Accurate Indoor Positioning for UWB-Based Personal Devices Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10054386)
2. [Reference Paper #2: UWB NLOS/LOS Classification Using Deep Learning Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9108193)

[DataSet]  
-Use data set and some function from https://github.com/ewine-project/UWB-LOS-NLOS-Data-Set.git  
-Get reference from https://github.com/JSYoon-git/UWB-LOS_NLOS-Classification-using-DL.git
